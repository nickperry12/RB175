RB175 - Networked Applications

This course covers and builds on the concepts of web developent and HTTP through practical application of the core web development concepts we learned in LS170. We'll be building small prgrams in Ruby, before moving on to work with a web development framework called Sinatra. We'll look at what's involved in deploying an application to the web, cover important security considerations, and experience using a structure development workflow.
